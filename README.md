It was a start-up company idea for helping the public sector in Ireland.

People can donate blood either in blood banks or in blood camps held by blood banks in the city. There are blood transfusion services for taking blood from a donor and storing of blood. If any local or new person in the city, wants to donate blood, then they need to search for specific blood transfusion service office or any other events. These transfusion service taking blood from a donor and after some testing, they are using those blood for further use or transfer it to hospitals.

Hospitals are dependent on blood banks for blood bags. So, they contact the blood bank and take blood bags. Blood banks have their own schedule for blood donation. They simply give some slots for limited clinics and donor has to go there and donate their blood. If possible, they used to take blood camps during various events in the city. The donor has to call them and ask for blood donation time and place every time.

In Dublin, there is only one service present for handling blood, which is “Irish Blood Transfusion Service (IBTS)”. They are working very well for a city like they provide a survey which is helpful for donors before donating blood, they provided some quiz which helps whether you can donate blood or not and many more. But from our point of view, they have to upgrade their service. They are working properly, and their services are good but, in some cases, they have limited services.

So, by keeping these factors in mind, I point out some problems with blood transfusion service and to solve these problems I created some solutions and many more in our Blood Bank Services startup business. In this report, I discussed those things in detail and with some factors which makes my start-up perfect.
